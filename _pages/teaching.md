# Teaching Experience

Since the beginning of my PhD program in October 2022, I have been actively involved in teaching and mentoring. Below is a summary of my teaching activities:

## Teaching Activities

### Master's Level Courses
- **Lecture Course: Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**  
  *Target Audience:* Second-year Master's students in Planetology and Space Exploration, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Description:* This course introduces students to the principles and applications of GIS in planetary sciences. It is followed by a tutorial about GIS using QuantumGIS. I have delivered this course every year from 2022 to 2024.

- **Tutorial Series: Remote Sensing of Planetary Surfaces**  
  *Target Audience:* First-year Master's students in Planetology and Space Exploration, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Description:* This series of 8 tutorials covers the fundamentals of remote sensing techniques and their application to planetary surface analysis. I have delivered these tutorials from 2022 to 2024.

## Mentoring Activities

### Undergraduate Research Supervision
- **April 2024:** Supervised four second-year undergraduate students pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering Science, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Project:* Introduction to research through a hands-on project which consit on labelisation of crater superposition using python.  

- **June 2024:** Supervised one second-year undergraduate student majoring in Earth, Planetary, and Environmental Sciences.  
  *Project:* Focused on planetary surface processes and their analysis using remote sensing techniques.
