During my PhD program, I have been actively involved in teaching and mentoring. At this day, I gave a total of 96h of teaching lessons. Below is a summary of my teaching activities:

## Teaching Activities

### Master's Level Courses
- **Lecture Course: Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**  
  *Target Audience:* Second-year Master's students in Planetology and Space Exploration, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Description:* This course introduces students to the principles and applications of GIS in planetary sciences. It is followed by a tutorial about GIS using QuantumGIS. I have delivered this course every year from 2022 to 2024.

- **Tutorial Series: Remote Sensing of Planetary Surfaces**  
  *Target Audience:* First-year Master's students in Planetology and Space Exploration, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Description:* This series of 8 tutorials covers the fundamentals of remote sensing techniques and their application to planetary surface analysis. I have delivered these tutorials from 2022 to 2024.

## Mentoring Activities

### Undergraduate Research Supervision
- **March - May 2024:** Co-supervised four second-year undergraduate students pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering Science, Paris-Saclay University.  
  *Project:* Introduction to research through a hands-on project which consists of labelizing crater superposition using Python.  
  *Duration:* 8 weeks  

- **June - July 2024:** Co-supervised one second-year undergraduate student majoring in Earth, Planetary, and Environmental Sciences.  
  *Project:* Focused on the re-evaluation of Apollo XI landing site geologic age using a deep-learning-based crater counting algorithm.  
  *Duration:* 8 weeks  

- **January 2025:** Supervised one middle school student during an observation internship.  
  *Project:* Crater database construction using a labelization algorithm.  
  *Duration:* 1 week  

- **June - July 2025:** Co-supervised one first-year MSc student majoring in Earth, Planetary, and Environmental Sciences.  
  *Project:* Automatic Thermokarstic lake in Yukon using segmentation algorithms.  
  *Duration:* 8 week

## Other  

- **Mars & May 2025:** Organisation and coordination of introductory astronomy days for elementary school students (4th and 5th grade), including solar observation workshops.
