#My research in a nutshell

Planetary surfaces undergo continuous transformation
driven by geological processes like volcanic eruptions and
impacts. Understanding the distribution of impact craters is
crutial to have a better comprehension of how planetary
surfaces envolve through time (Hartmann & Neukum,
Springer, 2001). My research project focus on the development of a
computer vision algorithm which automatically detect and
classify craters from planetary surfaces images to create a
comprehensive database encompassing crater positions, sizes,
and their geomorphological characteristics. The database will serve as a valuable
resource for planetary scientists, facilitating the study of
relative age, geological features distribution and so on,
enabling a deeper understanding of planetary geological
history and evolution.
