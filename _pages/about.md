## My Profile  

I am a French PhD student in planetary sciences, currently based at the GEOPS laboratory at Paris-Saclay University, under the supervision of Prof. [Frédéric Schmidt](https://fredericschmidt.github.io) and [François Andrieu](https://www.insu.cnrs.fr/fr/personne/francois-andrieu). My thesis, which will be defended in October 2025, focuses on the development of a **deep-learning algorithm for automatic crater detection and characterization** on planetary surfaces such as Mars, Mercury and the Moon.  

For now, I have actively contributed to planetary science research through:  
- Presented my work at international conferences, including 7 posters and/or talks.  
- Written 2 peer-reviewed articles (1 [published](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2025.106053) and 1 in prep.).  
- Taught over 96 hours of advanced courses to Master's students, focusing on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of planetary surfaces.  

My research focuses on :

- Artificial intelligence
- Qualitative geomorphology
- Remote Sensing (data, image, radar…)
- Mars and The Moon surfaces
- Earth observation


I am passionate about pushing forward our understanding of planetary evolution and I'am open to professional opportunities starting October 2025, following my thesis defense.  


## My research in a nutshell

During my PhD, I developed an Artificial Intelligence-based computer vision algorithm for the automated detection of craters on the surfaces of Mars and the Moon and the detection of thermokarstic lakes on Earth. This project has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills across multiple disciplines, including Environmental Sciences, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis, Remote Sensing, and Geomorphology. This work aim to the publication of two scientific articles in prestigious journals such as Planetary and Space Science and Icarus, as well as active participation in three major international conferences in the United States, Germany, and Finland. Additionally, this work has given me the opportunity to engage in teaching, delivering courses to MSc students in Planetary Sciences.
