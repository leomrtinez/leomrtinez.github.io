## My Profile  

I am a French PhD student in planetary sciences, currently based at the GEOPS laboratory at Paris-Saclay University, under the supervision of Prof. [Frédéric Schmidt](https://fredericschmidt.github.io) and François Andrieu. My thesis, which should be defended in October 2025, focuses on the development of state-of-the-art algorithms for automatic crater detection and characterization on planetary surfaces such as Mars, Mercury and the Moon.  

For now, I have actively contributed to planetary science research through:  
- Presenting my work at international conferences, including 7 posters and/or talks.  
- Publishing 1 peer-reviewed articles.  
- Teaching over 71 hours of advanced courses to Master's students, focusing on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of planetary surfaces.  

I am passionate about advancing our understanding of planetary evolution and I'm open to new professional opportunities starting October 2025, following my thesis defense.  


## My research in a nutshell

Planetary surfaces undergo continuous transformation
driven by geological processes like volcanic eruptions and
impacts. Understanding the distribution of impact craters is
crutial to have a better comprehension of how planetary
surfaces envolve through time ([Hartmann & Neukum](http://www.dejahvu.net/cydoniahappens/extras/hartmann.pdf),
Springer, 2001). My research project focus on the development of a
computer vision algorithm which automatically detect and
classify craters from planetary surfaces images to create a
comprehensive database encompassing crater positions, sizes,
and their geomorphological characteristics. The database will serve as a valuable
resource for planetary scientists, facilitating the study of
relative age, geological features distribution and so on,
enabling a deeper understanding of planetary geological
history and evolution.
