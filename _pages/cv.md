## Work Experience

### Research Experience

- **Research Intern, GEOPS Laboratory, Orsay**  
  March–August 2022  
  - **Subject:** Automatic crater detection using computer vision algorithms
  - **Supervision:** [Frédéric Schmidt](https://fredericschmidt.github.io) and [François Andrieu](https://www.insu.cnrs.fr/fr/personne/francois-andrieu)
  - **Key Contributions:**
    - Application of a **deep-learning** computer vision model to detect craters on planetary surface images, achieving high accuracy in test datasets.  
    - Preprocessed high-resolution planetary datasets (e.g., Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter/CTX) to optimize input for deep learning workflows.  
    - Automated data annotation and augmentation to improve the model's performance across diverse planetary terrains.  
    - Validation of the results by comparing detected craters with existing databases, demonstrating significant consistency and robustness.  
    - Development of a Python-based pipeline for end-to-end crater detection, including preprocessing, model training, and post-processing. 
    - Participation in the bi-annual "Programme National de Planétologie" symposium to present my work with a poster.  

- **Research Intern, LGLTPE Laboratory, Lyon**  
  *March–August 2021*  
  - **Subject:** Global-scale classification of Martian datasets using unsupervised machine learning algorithms  
  - **Supervision:** [Cathy Quantin-Nataf](https://eplanets.univ-lyon1.fr/equipe/permanents/cathy-quantin/)  
  - **Key Contributions:**  
    - Application of **machine learning** clustering algorithms to classify various global-scale Martian surface data products provided by instruments such as OMEGA, THEMIS, GRS, and MOLA. 
    - Preprocessed and analyzed large planetary datasets using **Python** and geospatial libraries (**GDAL**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**). 
    - Integrated results into **ArcGIS** and **QGIS** for spatial visualization and refinement of classification outputs.  
    - Evaluated the geological significance of classified regions by correlating clusters with known mineralogical and morphological features.  
    - Contributed to advancing methodologies for planetary surface mapping, enhancing understanding of Martian surface composition.  

 
- **Research Intern, IRAP Laboratory, Toulouse**  
  *March–August 2020*  
  - **Subject:** Looking for seismic doublets at 2.4Hz in InSight/Seis data
  - **Supervision:** [Ludovic Margerin](https://doctorat.univ-toulouse.fr/as/ed/detailResp.pl?resp=14231&site=EDT&ed=178)
  - **Key Contributions:**
    - Applied advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., band-pass filtering, cross-correlation) to identify recurring seismic events in SEIS data.  
    - Developed Python scripts leveraging **SciPy** and **NumPy** for automated detection and analysis of seismic doublets.  
    - Analyzed frequency spectra and time delays between doublets to infer source characteristics.  
    - Provided insights into the internal structure and seismic activity of Mars based on the detection or non-detection of seismic doublets.  

- **Research Intern, IRAP Laboratory, Toulouse**  
  *May-June 2019*  
  - **Subject:** Seismicity of the moon
  - **Supervision:** [Ludovic Margerin](https://doctorat.univ-toulouse.fr/as/ed/detailResp.pl?resp=14231&site=EDT&ed=178)
  - **Key Contributions:**
    - Application of a radiative transfer and diffusion model to analyze lunar seismic data, focusing on the behavior of seismic coda signals.  
    - Data analysis and model implementation with **Python**.  
    - Used the geophysical library [**BurnMan**](https://github.com/geodynamics/burnman) to simulate and infer planetary interior structures.  
    - Measured the regolith thickness using seismic modeling techniques.  
  

### Other professional experiences
